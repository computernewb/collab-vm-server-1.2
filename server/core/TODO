- Make core a shared library.
    Note that there are no guarantees on ABI safety (at least yet),
    as core is only expected to be consumed by collab3 binaries

    (dunno about this. If we do this, collab3 will probably end up having to export asio & beast,
     which are both very much not ABI safe, so dunno /shrug. To "lessen" the pain we could possibly move those
     to another shared library (or one per library, which is probably better), sover marked with each library's versions,
     to be nice to ABI.)


Config:
- add TOML backend
    TOML store should be like:

    [collab3.host]
    listen_at = "127.0.0.1"
    listen_port = 2000

    which will write to the namespace collab3.host
    (collab3 being a namespace in the global namespace)

core/http:
    - full rewrite, using
