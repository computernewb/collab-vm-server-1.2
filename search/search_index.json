Notice Windows is not supported by the Collab3 developers, and the project will not configure if targeting a Windows platform. This is an intentional change, and it will not be reverted until: DBus p2p works on Windows Windows QEMU supports modules, and passing handles to and from QEMU and another process Dependencies GCC 11+ or Clang 14+ are recommended compiler versions, however newer versions are acceptable too. Libraries: Boost 1.75 or above fmt spdlog You can use either system library versions (if preferred) or use vcpkg for the grunt of them. Building Collab3 Monorepo C++ Code The general formula is: $ cmake -B build --preset $PRESET $ cmake --build build # ... # profit? where $PRESET can be: release : Release build debug : Debug build debug-asan : Debug build (with AddressSanitizer enabled) debug-tsan : Debug build (with ThreadSanitizer enabled) There are also a few others, but they are only for use by our CI, and shouldn't be used. To use vcpkg, add --toolchain $VCPKG/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake to the CMake generation command line. For now, you'll get one collab3-host executable in the build root. This is the one you should run. Building Collab3 Monorepo Documentation Note that usually you won't have to do this, as the web documentation will update upon any changes to the documentation in the master branch.
